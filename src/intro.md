# Introduction to High-Performance Computing

This is a companion book to a course that I've been teaching at the university
level for more than a decade.  It was originally designed as course for
first-year graduate engineering students to prepare them for a research career in
computational science.

The expectation for the students enrolled in this course is the student has
little or no experience with Unix/Linux operation systems and has some
experience in computer programming in any language.  Some basics of the Unix
operation system, command line, and useful commands are covered in the first chapter
along with git/Github and the vi/vim editor.

The second chapter contains a short introduction to the Julia programming
language.  When originally designed, the course was taught in Python, but in
2022 I switched to Julia because it simply is *the* high-performance language.
