# Introduction to Julia

This chapter contains a succinct introduction to the Julia programming language.  It's written 
with the expectation that the reader has some familiarity with computer
programming languages.  For example, someone who has been programming in Python
should be able able to grasp the concepts as presented in the coming sections.
This chapter is not a replacement for the Julia Language documentation which is
very thorough and will be referenced throughout for further reading.
